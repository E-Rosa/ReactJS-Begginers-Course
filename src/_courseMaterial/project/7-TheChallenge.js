/*
Now that we've learned the basic concepts of React and also put it into practice together,
it's time for you to walk with your own legs. The challenge is to take the ProductsPage 
without any React code on it under materials/shopping-cart-html-css/ProductsPage.js
and make it work by yourself. Try to not look at the code we've made together for the
project. Rather, look at the lessons again, and there you shall find all answers. Good luck!
